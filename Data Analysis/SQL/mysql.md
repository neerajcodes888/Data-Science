## üß© 1. BASIC SQL (DQL)

```sql
-- 1. Select all columns from 'employees'
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- 2. Select specific columns
SELECT emp_id, emp_name FROM employees;

-- 3. Filter records where salary > 50000
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

-- 4. Use BETWEEN on hire_date
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE YEAR(hire_date) BETWEEN 2020 AND 2024;

-- 5. Use IN to find employees in HR, IT
SELECT * FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE dept_name IN ('HR', 'IT');

-- 6. LIKE for names starting with 'J'
SELECT emp_name FROM employees WHERE emp_name LIKE 'J%';

-- 7. IS NULL to find employees without department
SELECT * FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE d.dept_name IS NULL;

-- 8. Order by salary descending
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- 9. Count total number of employees
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total Employees" FROM employees;

-- 10. Find min, max, avg salary
SELECT 
    MIN(salary) AS "Minimum", 
    MAX(salary) AS "Maximum", 
    ROUND(AVG(salary), 2) AS "Average"
FROM employees;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è 2. SQL FUNCTIONS

```sql

FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY dept_name;

-- 17. Avg salary per department
SELECT dept_name, ROUND(AVG(salary), 2) AS "Average Salary"
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY dept_name;

-- 18. Departments with > 5 employees
SELECT dept_name, COUNT(*) AS "Total Employees"
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY dept_name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;

-- 19. Max salary per department
SELECT dept_name, MAX(salary) AS "Max Salary"
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY dept_name;

-- 20. Count employees joined each year
SELECT YEAR(hire_date), COUNT(*) AS "Joined"
FROM employees
GROUP BY YEAR(hire_date);
```

LEFT JOIN sales s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id;

-- 23. RIGHT JOIN with departments
SELECT * FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- 24. FULL OUTER JOIN simulation (MySQL)
SELECT * FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
UNION
SELECT * FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- 25. JOIN 3 tables
SELECT * FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
JOIN sales s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id;
```

## üéØ 5. SUBQUERIES & SET OPERATIONS

```sql
-- 26. Employees with salary > avg salary
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

-- 27. Departments with no employees
SELECT * FROM departments d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM employees e WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id
);

-- 28. Employees who made a sale in Jan but not in Feb
SELECT * FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM sales s
  WHERE s.emp_id = e.emp_id AND MONTH(s.sale_date) = 1
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM sales s
  WHERE s.emp_id = e.emp_id AND MONTH(s.sale_date) = 2
);

-- 29. UNION
SELECT dept_id FROM employees
UNION
SELECT dept_id FROM departments;

-- 29b. UNION ALL
SELECT dept_id FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT dept_id FROM departments;

-- 30. INTERSECT / EXCEPT (PostgreSQL or Oracle only)

INTERSECT
SELECT dept_id FROM departments;

SELECT dept_id FROM employees
EXCEPT
SELECT dept_id FROM departments;
